## Mini Challenge for Notion @ APU

Create a new custom Notion Widget and the most creative and useful one wins the challenge

The code below is the boilerplate that I provided for you to help kickstart your first widget creation.

```tsx
import React from "react";

// Note: Replace {WidgetName} with the name that you used to create the widget.

const {WidgetName} = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, Weejet!</h1>
      <p>This is my custom widget.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default {WidgetName};
```
